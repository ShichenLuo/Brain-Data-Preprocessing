     If used correctly, this program can be a very useful workhorse. In
     addition to converting images between different formats, it can be used to
     extract specific studies from a data set, extract a specific region of
     interest, or flip the images. Some of the possible operations are
     described in more detail below.

     Note that for both the -coord and -axes options, indexing starts from 0
     rather than 1. E.g. -coord 3 <#> selects volumes (the fourth dimension)
     from the series; -axes 0,1,2 includes only the three spatial axes in the
     output image.

     Additionally, for the second input to the -coord option and the -axes
     option, you can use any valid number sequence in the selection, as well as
     the 'end' keyword (see the main documentation for details); this can be
     particularly useful to select multiple coordinates.

     The -vox option is used to change the size of the voxels in the output
     image as reported in the image header; note however that this does not
     re-sample the image based on a new voxel size (that is done using the
     mrgrid command).

     By default, the intensity scaling parameters in the input image header are
     passed through to the output image header when writing to an integer
     image, and reset to 0,1 (i.e. no scaling) for floating-point and binary
     images. Note that the -scaling option will therefore have no effect for
     floating-point or binary output images.

     The -axes option specifies which axes from the input image will be used to
     form the output image. This allows the permutation, omission, or addition
     of axes into the output image. The axes should be supplied as a
     comma-separated list of axis indices. If an axis from the input image is
     to be omitted from the output image, it must either already have a size of
     1, or a single coordinate along that axis must be selected by the user by
     using the -coord option. Examples are provided further below.

     The -bvalue_scaling option controls an aspect of the import of diffusion
     gradient tables. When the input diffusion-weighting direction vectors have
     norms that differ substantially from unity, the b-values will be scaled by
     the square of their corresponding vector norm (this is how multi-shell
     acquisitions are frequently achieved on scanner platforms). However in
     some rare instances, the b-values may be correct, despite the vectors not
     being of unit norm (or conversely, the b-values may need to be rescaled
     even though the vectors are close to unit norm). This option allows the
     user to control this operation and override MRrtix3's automatic detection.

       $ mrconvert in.mif -coord 3 0 -axes 0,1,2 out.mif
     The -coord 3 0 option extracts, from axis number 3 (which is the fourth
     axis since counting begins from 0; this is the axis that steps across
     image volumes), only coordinate number 0 (i.e. the first volume). The
     -axes 0,1,2 ensures that only the first three axes (i.e. the spatial axes)
     are retained; if this option were not used in this example, then image
     out.mif would be a 4D image, but it would only consist of a single volume,
     and mrinfo would report its size along the fourth axis as 1.

     MRtrix3 uses a RAS (Right-Anterior-Superior) axis convention, and
     internally reorients images upon loading in order to conform to this as
     far as possible. So for non-exotic data, axis 1 should correspond
     (approximately) to the anterior-posterior direction.

     This example demonstrates two features: Use of the colon syntax to
     conveniently specify a number sequence (in the format 'start:step:stop');
     and use of the 'end' keyword to generate this sequence up to the size of
     the input image along
